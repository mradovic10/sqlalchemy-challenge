# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 Challenge

For this challenge, I was tasked with completing a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii. First, I analyzed and explored the climate data offered in the 'hawaii.sqlite' file with the help of Jupyter Notebook. SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used for this purpose. Specific subjects that were analyzed are precipitation, weather stations, and temperature observations (tobs).

Next, I created a Climate App by designing a Flask API based on the queries from the first section. The homepage of the App offers the user five routes to specified APIs.

This repository includes the 'climate_data' Jupyter Notebook file and the 'app' Python file. Comments and relevant notes are found throughout both files. Furthermore, there is a 'Resources' folder that contains the 'hawaii.sqlite', 'hawaii_measurements', and 'hawaii_stations' files.
